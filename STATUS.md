# STATUS / CHECKPOINT

**Last updated:** 2026-09-25 16:00 CDT (Hourly dual-agent — claim_gate named on all five ENTERPRISE measurement-chain pages)

## Completed this turn (dual-agent run)

### Agent 1 — Code Structure & Prototype Upgrader
- Extended the host-stubs forbidden paragraph on the five measurement-chain pages so `claim_gate` is listed with `energy_observer`; the refuse token `observer_not_evidence` for field_generation / quote_evidence / result_record is now visible from the documentation side of the same chain that the module docstrings already name

### Agent 2 — Enterprise & Business Ventures Agent
- Updated `ENTERPRISE/measurement-hold.md`, `named-lab-plan.md`, `instrument-list.md`, `measurement-method.md`, and `result-record.md` in lockstep; no prices, customers, SLAs, or invented lab names. Completes the bidirectional honesty link started in the prior hour (code docstrings ↔ ENTERPRISE chain)

## Prior completed (still true)
- energy_observer + claim_gate module docstrings name the full measurement-chain path
- Shared `feed_via_reader` path used by first_boot, duty_to_policy.fixture_log, and compose_first_boot (DRY host feed contract)
- `READER_META_KEYS` frozenset + contract assert inside `feed_via_reader`; reader tests CI-gated
- Host voltage reader stub (`host_voltage_reader.py`, tests) with allowed sources host_placeholder | hardware_pending only
- Host policy interface contract for future ADC documented in FIRST-BOOT.md
- Host first-boot refuse sketch (`first_boot.py`, `test_first_boot.py`, `FIRST-BOOT.md`)
- Host duty→policy adapter with optional via_host_reader on `fixture_log`
- Host composition demo folded into `run_prototypes.py` with optional via_host_reader
- BOM first-boot checkbox closed (host only)
- `ENTERPRISE/automation-note.md` (buyers not asked to push GitHub)
- All **50 model cards** present under `MODELS/genetic-architectural-database/models/`.
- **50 agents** registry complete (`AGENTS/fifty-agents.md`, `agent_registry.py`, tests).
- Offgrid TinyML-first primary workload + refuse path documented.
- Energy-harvester-tinyml honesty block and Model 01 / Model 05 mapping.
- ENTERPRISE inquiry process, placeholder tiers, well-being alignment live.
- Named-lab-plan, instrument-list, measurement-method, measurement-hold, and result-record pages carry the same non-evidence restatement.
- FIRST-BOOT rule 2 names the complete measurement-chain path.

## Honesty (what "finished" means)
Finished here = first_boot, duty adapter, and composition all exercise the same
host_voltage_reader feed contract via the shared `feed_via_reader` helper,
reader meta keys are contract-checked at the helper and at all three host
call sites (first_boot / fixture_log / compose), and the reader tests are
CI-gated, while every record stays tagged host-only and is_field_measurement=False.
The full measurement-chain pages (hold, named-lab-plan, instrument-list,
measurement-method, result-record) carry the same non-evidence restatement,
the host energy_observer + claim_gate modules name that chain from the code
side, and the five ENTERPRISE pages now also list claim_gate so refused
claims stay mapped to observer_not_evidence from both directions.
Not finished = ESP32-C3 ADC wiring, on-device first-boot firmware, calibrated C,
measured joules, or physical assembly photos.

## Next logical priorities
1. Implement a real ESP32-C3 (or SBC) ADC reader that returns only
   `pack_volts: float` and feeds the documented first_boot / energy_duty
   contract (or keep the host path explicit).
2. Name a lab + instrument class only when ready; do not invent results.
3. Keep first-boot, host_voltage_reader, duty fixture, composition, energy_observer,
   and claim_gate as host-only until a board exists; do not call them firmware.
4. Continue monitoring; prefer small honesty-preserving improvements over volume.

## Standing Directive
Quality first. Specialized agents authorized. GitHub updated through the
connector — the human is not the copy-paste step.
